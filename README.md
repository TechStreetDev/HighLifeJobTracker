# *The Unofficial* HighLife Job Tracker
## About the Project
This project is the front end to my custom HighLife Job Tracker tracking clock in data from a live-clock-ins channel. Allowing the HighLife servers whitelist jobs to actively track and monitor activity imported live straight from discord.

This project is required to be paired with the backend implementation and the database structure which **is not open source**

If you wish to use this project for a whitelist job that doesnt already use it, please reach out via discord at **@techstreet**

I am fully aware this isnt the tidyest, cleanest code or even best implementation of how this could work, however it is functional and does the job allowing whitelists to track data actively.

## Frameworks
This project uses AstroJS https://astro.build/ and is uses the tailwind addon for styling and css https://tailwindcss.com/
